## Unreleased

### Added

- Binary Download: Instead of relying on the `cwebp` binary being installed on the system, the
extension will now download a binary itself.

- Prefer System Binary: A user may configure to prefer a binary found on the system. The default
is to use the downloaded binary.

- Convert multiple files at once.
